# Latitudinal changes in the morphology of submarine channels: Reevaluating the evidence for the influence of the Coriolis force

This repository contains materials associated with a manuscript in press entitled "Latitudinal changes in the morphology of submarine channels: Reevaluating the evidence for the influence of the Coriolis force" by Zoltan Sylvester and Carlos Pirmez. The manuscript will be published in SEPM Special Publication No. 108, entitled "Latitudinal Controls on Stratigraphic Models and Sedimentary Concepts", DOI: 10.2110/sepmsp.108.02.

## Code

This folder contains the Jupyter Notebook that was used to read in channel centerlines (stored in KML format), convert them from longitude-latitude format to UTM coordinates, calculate curvature and sinuosity, and plot the results.

## Data

This folder contains the channel centerlines used in the analysis, in KML format. These were digitized in Google Earth, using images that were georeferenced.
